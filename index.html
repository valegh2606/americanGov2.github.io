                <center><h1>The Branches of Government</h1></center>
                <p>The Federal Government is made up of three different branches to ensure a separation of powers. They are called the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. Their powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the President, and the Federal courts, respectively.  </p>

                <center><h1>The Legislative Branch</h1></center>
                <p>The legislative branch is also known as Congress, which is made up by the House and the senate. After the founding founders drafted the constitution, they debated over the types of legislatures it would have and eventually settled on having both equal representation and a proportional representation. Its power is to make laws, declare wars, regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and control taxing and spending policies.  It is the only branch that is elected directly by the people and is the only part of government that balances between power of the nation and the individual state. </p>

                <center><h1>How Does Congress Work?</h1></center>
                <p>The lower house, the house of representatives, is led by the speaker of the house who initiates tax laws, spending bills, and initiates impeachment of the president or other government officials. The upper house, the Senate, has the exclusive power to approve presidential appointments and treaties. Congress uses the checks and balances system to prevent one branch from gaining too much power. Writing and passing bills is Congress’s main power for the federal government.  </p>

                <center><h1>Bills</h1></center>
                <p>After a bill originates in either the house or senate, it must pass through a series of committees, amendments and floor debates. After a vote, both houses must agree with the bill and if one makes changes, it needs to go back to the original house for another vote. The vice president oversees the senate but in the event of a draw, the vice may vote to break the tie. The House and Senate must agree and vote on the exact same bill before it can move on. If there is no agreement, the bill must be reintroduced, however, if it passes it may go to the president's desk for approval. If the president vetoes the bill, Congress may override it with a 2/3 majority vote from both houses. If approved, the president may sign it into law. </p>
